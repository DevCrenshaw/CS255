Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project involved designing a web-based system for a client who wanted to enhance driver education. The platform aimed to offer online study materials for theoretical driving exams and facilitate scheduling of practical driving sessions. It required features for account creation, package purchases, online studying and testing, and appointment booking. The system also needed to allow DriverPass employees to manage customer accounts and appointments.

What did you do particularly well?
The respondent felt their strength lay in creating clear, understandable diagrams that effectively visualized key aspects of the application in the second project.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
For improvement, they identified the Business Requirements Document from the first project, specifically the sections on assumptions and limitations, as an area that could benefit from more comprehensive treatment.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
To address user needs, the respondent analyzed the technical requirements and interview data, translating these into use cases and visual diagrams. This approach helped them conceptualize user requirements and adapt them to web functionality. They emphasized the critical importance of prioritizing user needs in design, given that users are the primary interactors with the system.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Their software design approach involved categorizing requirements as functional or non-functional. They found great value in creating various diagrams (use case, UML, Gantt) to visualize the application's intended functionality and to communicate design concepts effectively to others.
